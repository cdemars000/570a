    "The second lesson introduces the Unix filesystem, which underlies most of modern _big data_ analyses and our course analytics server. The Unix operating system is powerful and seemingly complex (especially for anyone who has only worked with a graphical user-based operating system such as Windows or Mac OSX ). In this course we will not explore all of these complexities, and instead focus solely on how data is persisted so that we can read and write data as needed on our course server.\n",
