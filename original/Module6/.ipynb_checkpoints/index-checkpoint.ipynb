    "# Module 6: Introduction to Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Module, you will learn the basics of probability, and how it relates to statistical data analysis. First, you will learn about the basic concepts of probability, including random variables, the calculation of simple probabilities, and several theoretical distributions that commonly occur in  discussions of probability. Next, you will learn about conditional probability and Bayes theorem.  Third, you will learn to calculate probabilities and to apply Bayes theorem directly by using Python. Finally, you will learn to work with both empirical and theoretical distributions in Python, and how to model an empirical data set by using a theoretical  distribution.\n",
