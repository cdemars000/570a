    "# Module 5: Introduction to Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "This module introduces visualization as an important tool for exploring and understanding data. First, the basic components of visualizations are introduced with an emphasis on how they can be used to convey information. Also, you will learn how to identify and avoid ways that a visualization can mislead or confuse a viewer. Next, you will learn more about conveying information to a user visually, including the use of form, color, and location. Third, you will learn how to actually create a simple visualization (basic line plot) in Python, which will introduce creating and displaying a visualization within a notebook, how to annotate a plot, and how to improve the visual aesthetics of a plot by using the Seaborn module. Finally, you will learn how to explore a one-dimensional data set by using rug plots, box plots, and histograms.\n",
