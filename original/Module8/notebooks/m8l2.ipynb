    "This lesson introduces the basic concepts behind density estimation, including kernel density estimation. In addition, the _violinplot_, a one-dimensional visualizations that employs a kernel density estimate, is introduced.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- articulate the basic concepts behind density estimations,\n",
    "- generate a rug plot form one-dimensional data,\n",
    "- discuss the relationship between a histogram, a rug plot, and a KDE plot, and\n",
    "- generate a violin plot, and discuss how it is different than a box plot.\n",
