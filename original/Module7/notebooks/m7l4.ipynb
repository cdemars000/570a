    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces ordinary linear regression, which can compute a _best-fit_ linear model between two dimensions. This linear model can be used (with certain caveats) for predictive analytics and also to visually understand relationships between different dimensions of a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand the concepts behind ordinary linear regression,\n",
    "- articulate the benefits of a linear model that has been coimputed from a data set, and\n",
    "- compute an ordinary linear regression model from a data set by using Python.\n",
