    "\n",
    "The first lesson introduces scatter plots as a technique for visually exploring two-dimensional data. This enables one to identify whether the two dimensions share a positive, negative, or null correlation as well as aids in the identification of outliers.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand how to use Matplotlib to make a scatter plot,\n",
    "- understand the difference between positive, negative, and null correlations,\n",
    "- understand how to graphically identify outliers, and\n",
    "- understand how to overplot and label multiple columns on a single scatter plot.\n",
