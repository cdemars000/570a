    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create multi-dimensional arrays by using NumPy,\n",
    "- access elements from multi-dimensional arrays,\n",
    "- use NumPy to operate efficiently on multi-dimensional data,\n",
    "- compute correlation measurements from NumPy arrays.\n",
