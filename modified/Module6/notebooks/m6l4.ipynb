    "## Introduction to Probability Distributions\t\n",
    "\n",
    "The final lesson introduces distributions, both empirical and theoretical, which provide concise representations of a data set. Understanding how to use and employ distributions will provide general guidance into modeling and interpreting a data set based on theoretical expectations.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- explain the difference between empirical and theoretical probability distributions,\n",
    "- explain the difference between key theoretical distributions like the Uniform, Binomial, Normal, Poisson, and LogNormal,\n",
    "- compute statistical descriptions from theoretical distributions,\n",
    "- apply QQ plots to test for normality,\n",
    "- explain the importance of the Central Limit Theorem, and \n",
    "- fit a theoretical distribution to an empirical data set.\n",
