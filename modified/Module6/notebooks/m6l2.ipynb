    "Reading: [Read about Conditional Probability and Bayes theorem][cpbt],  which is important in modeling real world problems. Note that the author of this article on occasion uses a non-traditional representation of conditional probability $P\\left(\\frac{A}{B}\\right)$ rather than the more commonly used $P(A |  B)$.\n",
