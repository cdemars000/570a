    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will understand how Python, and in particular the pandas module, can support many common Excel tasks.\n",

    "### Time Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 1 hour.\n",

    "Reading: A discussion on performing simple [Excel tasks in Python][etp] by using  the Pandas Module. Note, you do not need to master these skills, this is just a demonstration of how one migrates from Excel (or spreadsheets in general) to analytics with Python. Thus, you do not need to install the `fuzzywuzzy` module (unless you so wish).\n",
