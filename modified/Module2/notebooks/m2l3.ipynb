    "## Python Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces the concept of a function. Much like the equivalent in mathematics, a function takes input and generates output. By encapsulating algorithmic details in a function, you promote code reuse, increase efficiency by leveraging previous work, and reduce the likelihood for errors to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a function, \n",
    "- process input inside a function, and \n",
    "- return a new value from a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also learn how to create unnamed functions, known as _lambda functions_, and how to provide default values for functions.\n",

    "### Time Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 2 hours.\n",
