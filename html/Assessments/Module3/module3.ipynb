    "- Question: While data persistence is useful, why is it not optimal?\n",
    "  - Type: Multiple choice (Single Correct Answer)\n",
    "  - Choices: All data is written and read as Python strings. Complex arrangements of heterogenous data thus require potentially complex (and costly in execution time) transformations; All concurrency is provided by the file system, thus we are not guaranteed consistent results if multiple writers work at the same time; Without extra effort, for example, to write to a binary file or to employ compression, this approach is costly in terms of storage space; We rely completely on the underlying file system for consistency and durability. Thus, persisted application state may have unintentional dependencies on the underlying file system.\n",
