    "The third lesson introduces reading and writing data to a file by using Python. First, the Python context and the different modes by which a file can be opened (for reading, writing, or appending) are introduced. Next, reading and writing simple text data is demonstrated by using vanilla Python. Afterwards, delimited text data files are introduced, such as comma separated value (or CSV) files, which are read by using vanilla Python. Following this, Python module concept is presented and the `csv` module is used to simplify reading and writing comma separated value data. Finally, the Python concept of _pickling_ is demonstrated, by which complex Python data structures can be persisted.\n",
